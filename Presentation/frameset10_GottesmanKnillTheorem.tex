\begin{frame}{Gottesmanâ€“Knill Theorem}
    Suppose a quantum computation is performed which involves only the following elements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        State preparations in the computational basis
        \item
        Hadamard gates
        \item
        Phase gates
        \item
        Controlled-NOT gates
        \item
        Pauli gates
        \item
        Measurements of observables in the Pauli group
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace*{1mm}

    Together with the possibility of classical control conditioned on the outcome of such measurements.
    Such a computation may be efficiently simulated on a classical computer.
